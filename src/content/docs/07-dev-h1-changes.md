# H1 & Title Tag Updates

> **Every page needs a unique, keyword-optimized H1 and title tag. Here's the complete list of changes.**

---

## Why This Matters

- **Title Tag:** Appears in search results and browser tabs. Most important on-page SEO element.
- **H1 Heading:** Main heading on the page. Should match/complement the title tag.
- **Meta Description:** Doesn't directly impact rankings but affects click-through rate.

**Rules:**
1. Every page has exactly ONE H1
2. Title tag under 60 characters (or it gets cut off)
3. Meta description 150-160 characters
4. Primary keyword appears in both title and H1
5. Each page targets different keywords
