# Local SEO Strategy

> **For a local service business like yours, local SEO is everything. Here's how we'll make you the go-to concrete coating company in Colorado.**

---

## Why Local SEO Matters

When someone in Denver searches "concrete coatings near me," Google shows three types of results:

1. **Local Pack (Map Results)** - The map with 3 business listings
2. **Organic Results** - Regular website listings
3. **AI Overview** - Google's AI-generated summary

**Our goal:** Get you showing up in all three.

## Google Business Profile Optimization

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the single most important factor for local SEO. Here's what we're doing:

### Complete Profile Setup

| Element | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Business Name** | Verify correct name (no keyword stuffing) |
| **Categories** | Primary: Concrete Contractor. Add relevant secondary categories |
| **Description** | 750-word keyword-optimized description |
| **Services** | List all services with descriptions |
| **Service Areas** | Add all cities and zip codes you serve |
| **Hours** | Accurate business hours |
| **Phone** | Primary business number |
| **Website** | Link to homepage |
| **Appointment Link** | Direct scheduling link |

### Photo Strategy

**Goal: 100+ Photos**

| Photo Type | Quantity | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **Logo** | 1 | Brand recognition |
| **Cover Photo** | 1 | First impression |
| **Interior/Facility** | 5-10 | Show professionalism |
| **Team Photos** | 5-10 | Build trust |
| **Before/After Projects** | 50+ | Showcase quality |
| **Project Videos** | 5-10 | Engagement boost |

Photos should be high-quality, well-lit, and show the transformation clearly.

### Weekly GBP Posts

We'll post weekly updates including:
- Project completion photos
- Special offers or promotions

### Q&A Section

We'll pre-populate the Q&A section with 20-30 common questions:
- "How long does epoxy floor coating last?"
- "Do you serve [city name]?"
- "How much does garage floor coating cost?"
- "How long before I can walk on it?"
- "Do you offer warranties?"

This captures searches and shows you're responsive.
